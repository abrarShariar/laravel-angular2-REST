###  RESTful Backend with Laravel 5.3

* Some of the config files are not in the repo since they are kept as is out-of-the-box.

* Config your database:

```		
	./config/database.php
	./env
```

* Database schema is as follows:

```php
	Schema::create('employee', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->increments('id');     //primary key + auto increment
            $table->string('firstname');
            $table->string('lastname');
            $table->date('DOB');
            $table->string('description',100);
            $table->timestamps();       //'created_at' 'updated_at' cols
```

* Perform migration:

```sh
	php artisan migrate	
```

* [EmployeeTableSeeder](https://github.com/abrarShariar/laravel-angular2-REST/blob/master/database/seeds/EmployeeTableSeeder.php) defines the seeds for the database. For initial seeding:

```sh
	php artisan db:seed --class="EmployeeTableSeeder"
```
